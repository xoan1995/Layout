<h1>Tokyo</h1>
<p>Tokyo, (東京 Tōkyō, English: /ˈtoʊkioʊ/,[7] Japanese: [toːkʲoː] (About this soundlisten)) officially Tokyo Metropolis
    (東京都 Tōkyō-to), is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. It has served as the Japanese capital since 1869.[8][9] As of
    2018, the Greater Tokyo Area ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world. The urban area houses the
    seat of the Emperor of Japan, of the Japanese government and of the National Diet. Tokyo forms part of the Kantō
    region on the southeastern side of Japan's main island, Honshu, and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara
    Islands.[10] Tokyo was formerly named Edo when Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603. It
    became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed
    Tokyo.[11] The Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the
    city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi). Tokyo is often referred to as a city but is officially known and governed as a
    "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic
    unique to Tokyo.</p>

    world's 11th-most expensive city according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's cost-of-living survey.[18] In 2015,
    Tokyo was named the Most Liveable City in the world by the magazine Monocle.[19] The Michelin Guide has awarded
    Tokyo by far the most Michelin stars of any city in the world.[20][21] Tokyo was ranked first out of all sixty
    cities in the 2017 Safe Cities Index.[22] It was also ranked the first in the 2019 safe cities index.[23] The QS

    2018.[25] Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, the 1979 G-7 summit, the 1986 G-7 summit, and the 1993 G-7 summit,
